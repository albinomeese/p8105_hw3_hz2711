Exploration of instacart dataset

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

The `instacart` dataset has 1384617 observations of 15 variables. The
variable names are order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order,
reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow,
order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name,
aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department. Variables that are
specific to the items include `product_id`, `department`,
`product_name`, and `aisle`. Vvariables that are specific to the
consumer include `reordered`, `user_id`, `days_since_prior_order`, and
`order_dow`. This dataset has 131209 unique customers.

Data cleaning and exploration of BRFSS data set

In 2002, states that were observed at 7 or more locations are CT, FL,
MA, NC, NJ, PA. In 2010, states that were observed at 7 or more
locations are CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA.

# Problem 3

Tidy and clean accelerometer data and then create a table and a plot.

``` r
accel_data = read_csv("./Data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
    pivot_longer(
        activity.1:activity.1440,
        names_to = "activity",

            TRUE ~ "weekday"),
        day = fct_relevel(day, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")))
```

There are total 50400 observations and 6 variables. The variables in
this data set are week, day\_id, day, activity, activity\_count,
day\_type.

``` r

No significant activity trends appear. However, the last two weekends
showed much lower activity counts than in previous weeks and weekends.
Furthermore, the middle of the week generally showed less activity
counts than other days of the week.

minute.

``` r
